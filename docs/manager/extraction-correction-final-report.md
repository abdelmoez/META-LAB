## 37.1 Executive summary

This round corrected the trust-critical failures of the assisted-extraction workspace and
laid the deterministic, tested engine foundation the RoadMap/4.md workstreams require. It is
a **correction + engine-foundation** pass, honest about what remains UI-side.

**What was rebuilt / added (all pure, deterministic, tested, additive):**

1. **One shared cell grammar** (`cellGrammar.js`, §13) — `parseCell` returns a discriminated
   ParsedCell (INT/FLOAT/PCT/N_OF_N/MEAN_SD/CI/P/MISSING) that preserves raw text, keeps the
   p-value inequality, and **never silently reorders a reversed CI** (it warns). `snapToken`
   powers click-assign. This replaces the six divergent number parsers the audit found.
2. **Shared effect formatter** (`format/formatEffect.js`, §18) — back-transforms log/logit/
   Fisher-z stored effects for display. **Fixes the production bug**: `es=0.1133…, lo=0,
   hi=0.2311…` now renders **`RR 1.12 [1.00, 1.26]`**, not the raw log value labelled as a ratio.
   Wired into the draft cards and the "Also reported" list (both workspace mounts).
3. **Value-precedence engine** (`valuePrecedence.js`, §27/§4.3) — one `decideWrite` decision
   (write / propose-replace / keep-existing / add-alternative). Wired into click-assign so a
   click that would replace an existing value now **asks first** (§21.5) instead of silently
   overwriting — the worst finding in the audit.
4. **Stable identity + reconciliation** (`draftReconcile.js`, §10.5/§19.10/§4.4) — drafts get a
   source-derived identity (not a random id); rerunning a machine pass is **idempotent** (no
   duplicate drafts) and a **dismissed finding is not resurrected**. Wired into add/dismiss.
5. **Staged table pipeline** (`pdfTextGrid.js` +306 lines, §12) — `repairTokens` fixes mid-word
   splits (`u`+`nivariate` → `univariate`); `stripCaptionAndFootnotes` keeps a caption subtitle
   out of the data body; `mergeWrappedRows` stitches wrapped labels **and** preserves indented
   arm sub-rows as hierarchy; `buildTableGrid` emits the §10.2 contract with `PARSER_VERSION`.
6. **Table-shape classifier extended** (`tableShape.js`, §14) — the 4.md 5-shape vocabulary via
   `canonicalShape`, plus `evidence[]`, `alternates[]` (the ≤0.15 rule), and PICO-assisted arm
   matching (`armMatch.js`) that **never assigns an arm positionally**. The internal 3-shape
   scoring and its golden tests are preserved byte-compatibly.
7. **Page layout / OCR normalizer / auto-calibrate** (`pageLayout.js` §19.1, `ocr/normalizeOcr.js`
   §24.4, `digitizer/autoCalibrate.js` §22) — the pure engines for two-column survey, OCR-to-
   pdf-item mapping, and confirm-first axis reading.
8. **Fixtures + generator + dump helper** (§11) — `scripts/dump-text-items.mjs` (real pdf.js
   dumps) and 7 labelled-synthetic fixtures with expected blocks and an integration test.

The system is **safer** because: user values can no longer be silently overwritten; ratio
effects can no longer display as raw log numbers; reruns no longer duplicate work; every new
draft can carry a resolvable source identity. **Usability** improved at the two points a
reviewer actually feels risk (the overwrite prompt and the correct effect display). What stays
**manual by design**: confirming every machine draft (needsReview), confirming an axis reading,
and mapping any table the classifier marks `unknown`.

## 37.6 Compatibility review

- `mkStudy` shape: **untouched** (both factories).
- Analysis / RoB / GRADE / PRISMA / export schemas / `calcES` math: **untouched**; es/lo/hi
  remain analysis-scale strings — `formatEffect` back-transforms only at the display edge.
- `aiExtract` default-off behaviour: **untouched**.
- Existing golden tests (grid, tableShape 3-shape, records, digitizer math, outcomeMatch):
  **all still green** — every change was additive-exported.
- Draft/parked storage keys: additive only (`extractionDismissed[]` is new and optional).

## 37.7 Known limitations (explicit)

- The **real** Sujan/Khoury PDFs are not in the repo; acceptance for them is proven on
  labelled-synthetic companions that reproduce the described structure, not the real files.
- The **TableRegionMapper side-by-side crop + faithful replica + hover-sync** UI is not rebuilt;
  the mapper still uses its column-tagging surface (the engine to drive the rebuild — `buildTableGrid`,
  `renderRegion`, shape `evidence`/`alternates` — is now in place).
- The **PlotDigitizer confirm-first "I read the axes" UI** and **KM at-risk one-click parse** are
  not wired; `autoCalibrate` is the engine they will consume.
- **auto-generate** still runs its (precision-minded) prose engine; the table-first document
  **survey orchestrator** (`surveyExtract.js`) that runs `pageLayout`→`buildTableGrid`→`tableShape`
  before prose is the remaining WS3 integration.
- The **OCR service** (`src/frontend/services/ocr.js`) still uses a single worker without a
  cancellation API or digits mode; the pure normalizer + cache-key are ready for it.
- `firstNumber` remains as a no-offset click fallback (guarded to refuse ambiguous multi-number
  runs) pending full migration to `snapToken`.
- Heavily merged / graphical tables still fall back to manual mapping (a successful safe failure).

## 37.9 Files changed

**New pure engine modules:** `cellGrammar.js`, `format/formatEffect.js`, `valuePrecedence.js`,
`draftReconcile.js`, `armMatch.js`, `pageLayout.js`, `ocr/normalizeOcr.js`,
`digitizer/autoCalibrate.js`. **Extended:** `pdfTextGrid.js` (+staged pipeline), `tableShape.js`
(+5-shape/evidence/alternates/pico), `outcomeMatch.js` (+synonyms/version). **Wired (UI/state):**
`DraftReviewList.jsx` (formatEffect), `AssistedExtractionPanel.jsx` (overwrite guard),
`extractionTabs.jsx` (reconcile + dismissed identities). **Tooling/fixtures:**
`scripts/dump-text-items.mjs`, `scripts/gen-extraction-fixtures.mjs`,
`tests/fixtures/extraction/` (7 fixtures + README). **Tests:** 10 new unit/integration files.

## 37.10 Future-safe extension points

- **New cell grammar:** add a matcher in `cellGrammar.parseCell` (ordered most-specific-first).
- **New table shape:** add a scorer branch in `tableShape.detectTableShape` + a `CANONICAL_SHAPE` entry.
- **New outcome synonym:** append a group to `OUTCOME_SYNONYMS` and bump `OUTCOME_SYNONYMS_VERSION`.
- **New figure type:** consume `autoCalibrate.autoCalibrateAxis` from the digitizer with the type's tick-harvest rule.
- **New provenance method / origin:** extend `valuePrecedence.ORIGIN_RANK` and `draftReconcile.IDENTITY_PARTS`.
